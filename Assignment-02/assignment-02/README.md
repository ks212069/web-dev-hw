For web design, I know the basics to build a website. However, I am just an amateur and I want to better understand how websites work.
I'm taking this class because I want to be able to go into the job field and know another trade to put me ahead of others.
I'm currently working as a design assistant. I could be valued more if I know how to better code in HTML and CSS. Furthermore, web design is really cool
in general. People can just make a site over night, maintain them, and have them reach audiences. Our society isn't jumping offline anytime soon, I believe that more people should be given the chance to learn how to design websites.

Some things I would love to learn from this class would be:
1. Making a full functioning website
2. Making a modern and fresh designs
3. Finding the problematic areas in code that can improve websites.
