# Here is my answers for the readme section.
<head> has a variety of elements to direct the page. Such as meta, viewport, title, style, and link. The <head> elements tell the browser and processor information about the HTML document, such as the title, author, and publication date. <head> is the part of the document that is the chunky meaty bits that give the reader to actual read. This can include lists, paragraphs, links, etc.  


Structural are the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.
Semantic are the elements that provide extra info, such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation, the meaning of acronyms, etc.

My work cycle has been a lot more flowing? I don't need to jump around to much by directly uploading or editing the Github website. The desktop app has been wonderful to use. I just edit my html, in this case my index and readme, and commit to master, and then push the origin. Super easy! I wish I wish I did it sooner.
