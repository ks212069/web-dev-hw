Forms I have seen across the web that I have found would be blog forms, news websites, troubleshooting forms, forms for business, etc. Forms collect and manage info easily and efficiently.
Text is where users type in information. Selection is easier when it gives the user a select amount of predetermined choices. Buttons are common interactive features in web design, and can provide graphic interest as well as functionality to your links and fields.
I feel like I could use more practice regarding making the tables, while it seems long, I got mixed up between the rows and columns. I understood the button part of the assignment.
