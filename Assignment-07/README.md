1)Divs can be singular or nested within each other. This element is heavily used by developers to increase structural clarity and identify element groups. This in turn, increases readability, which is always desired. The class attribute is an identifier and selector value for HTML elements. The class attribute groups similar types of elements together by using the same name value. This allows for easy styling of these elements with same CSS code.
Following from the idea of identification labels, the “id” attribute takes as its value a string, which should be a unique identifier to that specific element. The span element is the inline equivalent of the <div> element. Stacked building blocks with stickers representing span elements
This means that spans can exist within divs, and do not create full-width blocks. It serves to identify or group content together that requires organization or extra styling. You can have multiple span elements inside a div.

2)alt-text is more than basic descriptions on html files. This description is used by screen readers for those who are visually impaired. That way it creates an equality for all online users to access websites online.

3) I think I had a very difficult time processing the information as building blocks. By the time I reached the end of the assignment, my brain was just exhausted but I finally got the hang out it. This assignment was just different for me to build but I will just do more practice!
