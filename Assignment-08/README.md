1) Everything felt pretty new for me because I struggled with HTML in the past. Most of my web pages struggled to get online at all.
2)I'm not super great at coding, however I'm very excited to see what will happen next in regards to CSS.
3)It was mostly working with a lot of files open so I could check on everything working.
