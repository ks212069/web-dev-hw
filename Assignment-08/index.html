       <p> Hello and welcome to my Instructable for doing the art of Perler Beads!<br  />
       Don't be afraid to make some mistakes! However I will teach a easy way to begin!</p>

       <h2><b>Step One</b></h2>
       <img src="./images/step-01.jpg" alt="Step One">


       <p>Assemble your Perler beading supplies. You'll need a flat, stable area to make your Perler bead design. The pegboard you'll be using for your beads has very small pegs, so an unlevel surface may cause the beads to fall off. In all, for your Perler beading project, you'll need:
         <ul>
           <li>A peler pegboard</li>
           <li>An iron</li>
           <li>Perler Beads of all the same band</li>
           <li>Parchment paper</li>
         </ul><br  />

         Choose your pegboard or use a pattern. There are many shapes you can choose from. You could create a dog, a fish, a hexagon, a shoe and so on. Perler makes many different shapes of pegboards,
         but you could also use a pattern and a clear Perler pegboard. There are free resources of patterns and tutorials online! Please start small as too big and the next step will be difficult.
         </p><br  />

         <h2><b>Step Two</b></h2>
         <img src="./images/step-02.jpg" alt="Step Two">

         <p>Bead according to the pattern. If you are following a shaped pegboard, like a pegboard shaped like a cat for example, you should slip the beads onto the raised pegs in the arrangement you desire.
        If you are using a clear, square shaped pegboard, you should slide a pattern underneath before beading, or you could create a freeform design of your own making.
