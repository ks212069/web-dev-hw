What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?
-System fonts are already located on the local drive and system. Not always on the web. Web fonts are custom fonts hosted on a server. Most fonts should be considered on how they will affect the website for browser compatibility and load up speed. Web-safe fonts are considered available for developers for both Windows and Mac computers.

What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?
-The importance of having a fallback font would be because if a server does not have access to the first font, then the web client will move onto the next font in line until a font works.
