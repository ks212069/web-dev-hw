      <h1>The Great Gatsby</h1>
      <h2>F. Scott Fitzgerald</h2>

      <div class="text">
        <p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave
me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind
ever since.</p>
<p>‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me,
‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had
the advantages that you’ve had.’ </p>

<p>Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and
in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat
out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West
Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an
abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off,
leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees
and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth
blew the frogs full of life.
The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch
it I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had
emerged from the shadow of my neighbor’s mansion and
was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the
silver pepper of the stars.
Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn
suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to deter-
mine what share was his of our local heavens.</p>

<p>I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him
at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I
didn’t call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he
was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward
the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him I
could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced
seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green
light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of
a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished,
 and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.</p>
