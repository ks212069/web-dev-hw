Universal selector type is used to select all the elements on the page. Element selector type is used to select elements of a certain type.
Class selector types are used to select elements that serve the same function. ID selector types allows developers to define style rules for a specific element by calling its unique ID.
I may chose different selector types over others as they each serve their own separate function. Especially if I need to narrow down an element to alter the class or ID. Rather than use universal to select everything.
I chose 4 different colors that would be in a pink shades rather than orange or red. Pig Pink #FFDDEE(255, 221, 238),Pink Shampoo #FFCCEE,
Magneta-pink #FFBBEE(255, 204, 238), and  Pale Magneta #FFAAFF.

My work cycle dragged a lot. I am frustrated at myself for having some difficulties with css. I am pushing through late assignments now as I speak.
