I actually learned alot in this course. At the Missoula college, I had helped my mother with a html course similar to this and it helped me help her.
I think something wrong with that is the fact that they are only allowed to use Notepad++. Like they can't use Github or anything new. I learned how to link pages, how websites make embedding easier, and that Github is beyond a helpful resource for all coders to use.

I LOVED learning about fonts and changing font colors! Especially since it can be used between css and html.

I had to burn some candlelight, however I'm proud of how far I came. Even if I get just a 70% or a C in this course. I will continue to use the book and the videos to learn more about web design and improve myself further.
